# Try Plankton using Play-with-Docker

<!-- Plankton requires access to the Docker host via `/var/run/docker.sock`,
so those concerned (and rightly so) with running third-party containers
with access to the Docker host can try Plankton using
[Play-with-Docker](https ://labs.play-with-docker.com). -->
